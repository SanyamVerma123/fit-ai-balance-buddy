      question: "How do I track my meals effectively?",
      answer: "Use our AI-powered meal tracker to log your food. You can type food names (like '2 chapati'), take photos of your meals, or get AI suggestions. The system automatically calculates calories, protein, carbs, and fat content for accurate nutrition tracking."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the AI food recognition work?",
      answer: "Our AI uses advanced computer vision to analyze food photos and identify ingredients. Simply take a photo of your meal, and the AI will recognize the food items and estimate their nutritional content. For best results, ensure good lighting and clear images."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I set and track my fitness goals?",
      answer: "Navigate to your profile to set your fitness goals (weight loss, gain, or maintenance). The app will calculate your daily calorie needs and track your progress. Monitor your weight changes and nutrition intake through the Progress section."
    },
    {
      question: "What workout tracking features are available?",
      answer: "Track various exercises with duration, intensity, and calories burned. The AI can suggest workouts based on your goals and fitness level. All workout data is integrated with your nutrition tracking for comprehensive health monitoring."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the AI coaching work?",
      answer: "Our AI coach provides personalized advice based on your goals, current progress, and dietary preferences. Ask questions about nutrition, exercise, or general fitness. The AI remembers your conversation history for better context."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I track water intake?",
      answer: "Yes! Use the water tracker to log your daily hydration. Set reminders and track your progress toward daily hydration goals. Proper hydration is essential for optimal fitness results."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate are the calorie calculations?",
      answer: "Our AI provides estimates based on standard nutritional data and food recognition. For precise tracking, you can manually adjust values. The system learns from your inputs to improve accuracy over time."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I export my data?",
      answer: "Your data is stored locally on your device for privacy. You can view detailed progress reports and weekly summaries. Future updates will include data export features."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get the most accurate AI suggestions?",
      answer: "Be specific when describing foods (include quantity and preparation method). For photos, ensure good lighting and include the entire meal. The AI works better with clear, detailed inputs."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my data private and secure?",
      answer: "Yes! All your data is stored locally on your device. We don't collect or store personal information on external servers. Your privacy and data security are our top priorities."
